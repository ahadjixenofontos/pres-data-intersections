Note:
We're about to watch gentoo penguins, and try to interpret their behavior. Here's some context that may be useful. The penguin in the front is a parent, and the penguin in the back is the chick. 

What do you think they’re doing?

Those are colored by your experience of the world. YOUR experience
If you’re a mom and had a rough morning with the kid you may see it as the mom is running away. 
If you are a student you may see it as the chick learning how to get away from predators by mimicking its mom.
If you are an evolutionary biologist you may see it as the mom making sure that only the fittest offspring get fed
All you actually see is penguins running

Anthropomorphism is just one example of seeing things not as they are, but as we are.

Note:
We will spend the remainder of this talk exploring examples of how this shows up in the various stages of data analysis. 
As we saw with the penguins, having a sharpened intuition by repeated contact with a topic, like the evolutionary biologist, may help us get closer to the truth. As soon as you switch environments, or perhaps type of data, the intuition needs to be built up again.

Note:
Visualizing the rabbit hole which is actually an ant colony
The route you take through the colony depends on what drew you which is affected by your biases
You create a route based on who you are rather than what it actually is

Catalyze collaborations was a problem that was stated through my CCS glasses
Once we saw things through other people’s eyes (faculty who don’t want to be told to collaborate and other admins) the problem was reframed completely and became diffferent than what we originally thought it was
