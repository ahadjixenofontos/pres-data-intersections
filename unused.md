It's also possible to generate misleading results results not only during sampling, or by omitting key controls, but in the implementation of your code. This quote by Donald Knuth, author of The art of computer programming, a legendary book from 1968, communicates the difference between math and buggy reality. 

The fact that programming languages are much less ambiguous than natural languages makes it even more critical that we code with a conscious awareness of the biases that our code could introduce.
